In this end-of-degree work, we have tried to analyse the different methods of distributing seats, focusing on them from a novel perspective where the methods are analysed by experimentally varying the seats to be distributed, the number of parties running for election or the concentration of the vote.
It also analyses the degree of disproportionality resulting from having held elections in Spain according to the different methods of seat distribution.
